## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before you can run this program, you need to install **Tesseract OCR**.

1.  Download Tesseract OCR for Windows from **here (UB-Mannheim builds)**.

    - It is recommended to download the `tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-v5.x.x.exe` file.

2.  **Most Important Step:** After installation, go to the Tesseract installation folder (usually `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR`).

3.  **Copy** the entire `Tesseract-OCR` folder and **Paste** it into the root folder of this project. The final project structure should look like this:

    ```
    FloatingDictionary/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Tesseract-OCR/   <-- The folder you just copied
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tessdata/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tesseract.exe
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (‡πÑ‡∏ü‡∏•‡πå‡∏≠‡∏∑‡πà‡∏ô‡πÜ)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (other project files)
    ```

> This step is necessary to ensure the program can always find Tesseract, especially when it is packaged into an `.exe` file in the future.
